# CP/M Binaries

This directory contains a single binary which is used to test the emulator:

* [The lighthouse of Doom](https://github.com/skx/lighthouse-of-doom/)

Other CP/M code within the repository includes:

* The top-level [samples/](../samples/) directory contains some code which was useful to me to test my understanding, when writing the emulator.
* The top-level [static/](../static/) directory contains some binaries which are always available when launching our emulator.



## Other Binaries

There is a curated collection of binaries known to work with cpmulator in our sister repository:

* https://github.com/skx/cpm-dist

This collection includes Turbo Pascal, several BASIC interpreters, and various games from InfoCom including Zork 1, 2, and 3.
