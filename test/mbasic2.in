# The BBC BASIC interpreter needs the fake ^M
# to be inserted with our newlines, otherwise
# it won't react to keyboard input.
#
# We also have to pause on newlines, because otheriwse
# the "LIST" will poll for keyboard input and swallow
# some of the following characters.
#
# That will manifest itself as "LIST" working as expected
# but the next command being "N" showing a syntax error
# as the "RU" have been swallowed.
