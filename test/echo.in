# This test is annoying because it is logically simple, but
# complex in execution.
#
# In theory we just run "CC ECHO", "AS ECHO", and "LN ECHO.O C.LIB"
# however the compiler, assembler, and linker all seem to poll
# for keyboard input - and if they see input they abort.
#
# So we have to either use "#" to block execution for a few seconds
# here or there, or do the same for each newline.
