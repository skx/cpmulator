# This test is annoying because it is logically simple, but
# complex in execution.
#
# In theory we just run "CC ECHO", "AS ECHO", and "LN ECHO.O C.LIB"
# however the compiler, assembler, and linker all seem to poll
# for keyboard input - and if they see input they abort.
#
# So we have to use the "#" character in our runtime section, below,
# to pause execution and attempt to time things such that we don't
# block the execution and kill the test.
